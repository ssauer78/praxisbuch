This project is a Java tool with JavaFX interface. It originates in a cakePHP website I created for my girlfrinds ostepathy self-employment. 
But because of privacy protection we decided to not have a web interface. Also I wanted to get to know Java 8, so I decided to create a 
stand-alone application in Java. 

Features: 
* store the patients and appointments
* store expenses done (with date)
* export the data for the tax declaration
